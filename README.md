# Old-OS-Web
The code for all of the old objection studios website, or what's left of it.

Please note this is not the current code for "objectionstudios.com", it is the older version of it. I am not sure how much is the original,
this was taken during the time movement from the old code to the new code began.

Most of this is terrible programming that I did. I have moved to better methods and learned more CSS.
